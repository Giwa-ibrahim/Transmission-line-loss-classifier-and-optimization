# Transmission-line-loss-classifier-and-optimization
This project classifies transmission loss line and then calculate the revenue optimized.

Objective achieved:

* developed a data-driven transmission losses classification system using LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU models to create seven classification scenarios, where the BiLSTM gave the worst result while the hybrid LSTM-AM gave the best results for the hybrid models with an accuracy of 83.84%.

* The Particle swarm optimization (PSO) energy-saving strategy resulted into more than 90% energy savings, achieving the highest monetary savings of â‚¦178,351,372.4
